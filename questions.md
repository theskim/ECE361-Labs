Lab 1
Question: Can we use string functions on messages?

As UDP sends data in the form of datagrams (bytes), we should receive data in char* as buffer, hence we can apply string functions such as strcmp or strcat afterwards.

Lab 2
Question: How long is the measured round-trip time?
Around 0.0001 to 0.0003 seconds (0.1 - 0.3 ms)
